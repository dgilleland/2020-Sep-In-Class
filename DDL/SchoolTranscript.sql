-- Modifying Database Table Schemas with ALTER TABLE

-- Consider the fact that there may be data in the table
-- that you are trying to alter.
-- If you don't have a default value to apply when
-- adding your new column, then the new column should
-- allow NULL values.
ALTER TABLE Students
   ADD  Email   varchar(30)     NULL

/* Let's see what our table's data/structure looks like
-- Here's a quick'n'dirty way to see all the data

SELECT  *   -- * means "all columns" in my table
FROM    Students

*/
-- If you include a default with your new column,
-- you can make that column as Required (NOT NULL).
ALTER TABLE StudentCourses
    ADD     Paid    bit     NOT NULL
        CONSTRAINT DF_StudentCourses DEFAULT (0)

-- Comment out line(s) of code[Ctrl] + [k], [Ctrl] + [c]
-- SELECT * FROM StudentCourses

ALTER TABLE StudentCourses
    ADD  OverDue    bit     NULL

-- If I just want to add a constraint, such as a default
-- to an existing column (say, my OverDue column),
-- I can adjust the table for only the constraint
ALTER TABLE StudentCourses
    ADD CONSTRAINT DF_StudentCourses_OverDue
        DEFAULT (0) FOR OverDue
-- Also notice above that I have a slightly different
-- syntax for the default constraint:

-- Lastly, note that the new constraint will only apply
-- for new rows of data for my DEFAULT constraint.

/* ALTER TABLE Statements - PRACTICE */

-- A) Add column to the Courses table called "SyllabusURL" that is a variable-length string of up to 70 characters. Determine for yourself if it should be NULL or NOT NULL.
ALTER TABLE Courses
    ADD SyllabusURL varchar(70) NULL
/* 
SELECT * FROM Courses
INSERT INTO Courses(Number, Name, Credits, Hours, Active, Cost, SyllabusURL)
VALUES ('HACK-0001', 'White-Hat Hacking', 4.5, 90, 1, 450.00, 'gopher://hack.dev')
*/
-- B) Add a CHECK constraint to the SyllabusURL that will ensure the value matches a website URL (HTTPS://).
ALTER TABLE Courses
        WITH NOCHECK
    --  WITH NOCHECK means it will not apply the CHECK
    --               to the existing data in the table
    ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Courses_SyllabusURL
        CHECK (SyllabusURL LIKE 'https://%')
        --           Match for  'https://DMIT-1508.github.io'

/*
INSERT INTO Courses(Number, Name, Credits, Hours, Active, Cost, SyllabusURL)
VALUES ('PROG-0101', 'The NEW Programming Fundamentals', 4.5, 90, 1, 450.00, 'gopher://hack.dev')

-- C) One of the functions that we can use in SQL is the GETDATE() function that will return the current datetime. Use this GETDATE() function as the default value for new column in Students called "EnrolledDate".
ALTER TABLE Students
    ADD EnrolledDate    datetime    NOT NULL
        CONSTRAINT DF_Students_EnrolledDate
            DEFAULT (GETDATE())
-- SELECT * FROM Students
/*
-- Here's how you can drop constraints and columns:
ALTER TABLE Students
    DROP CONSTRAINT DF_Students_EnrolledDate
ALTER TABLE Students
    DROP COLUMN EnrolledDate
-- Here's re-adding the EnrolledDate and constraint as
-- two separate instructions
ALTER TABLE Students
    ADD EnrolledDate    datetime    NOT NULL
    
ALTER TABLE Students
    CONSTRAINT DF_Students_EnrolledDate
        DEFAULT (GETDATE()) FOR EnrolledDate

GO -- end the batch of statements that alter the database

/* CREATE INDEX */

-- Indexes improve the performance of the database when retrieving information. They do this by providing an additional "lookup" table that is sorted by the the indexed column(s).

-- When we create a table with a PRIMARY KEY, then that/those column(s) are given "clustered" indexes. In other words, the data in the database will (by default) be "sorted by" the Primary Key column(s).

-- We can add additional columns as indexes for quick lookup, but those have to be as "Non-Clustered" indexes.

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Students_Surname
    ON Students(Surname) -- lookup by last name

-- What should we index in our tables?
--   - Foreign Key Columns
--   - Anything else that will frequently be used as
--     something we either "lookup by" or "sort by"
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_StudentCourses_StudentID
    ON StudentCourses(StudentID)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_StudentCourses_CourseNumber
    ON StudentCourses(CourseNumber)


/* INDEX Statements - Practice */

-- A) Add an index for the Name column in the Courses table.
-- B) Add an index for the Year column in the StudentCourses table.
