# Team Work on GitHub

Follow these practices to ensure a smooth collaboration effort while sharing or working as a team in a GitHub repository.

1. **Never** commit/push broken code. If your code does not compile, do NOT commit/push the code to GitHub.
   1. Commit to a separate branch, if you need to.
1. **Do NOT** put off commiting/pushing your code!
1. **Commit/Push** frequently!
   1. Do a `pull` **before** you do your commit/push.
